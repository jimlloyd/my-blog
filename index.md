## Welcome

Welcome to **The Scientific Worldview**.  

*This site is a work in progress.*

### Purpose
This site is written for people who (for whatever reason) *don't* have a scientific worldview, but are curious to understand better what it is *like* to be someone that holds a scientific worldview.
 
### What is a *worldview*?

We'll use this definiton for *[worldview][1]* as taken from **[The Free Dictionary][2]**:

**worldview**

1. The overall perspective from which one sees and interprets the world.
2. A collection of beliefs about life and the universe held by an individual or a group.

Your worldview influences how you see and interpret the world. Your current beliefs about life and the universe influence how you interpret your experiences. Everyone has a worldview, because everyone has set of beliefs that influence how they interpret their experiences.

It may seem odd that we claim that your beliefs cause you to intrepret your experiences differently than if you had different beliefs. We'll have a lot to say about this elsewhere on this site.

### What is *science*?

Science is most often discussed as if it were a body of knowledge. But science is really best understood as a method for gaining knowledge about the natural world. The method is known as the **[Scientific Method](/the_scientific_method)**.
