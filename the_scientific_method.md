## The Scientific Method

The Scientific Method is described in detail in many places, but that detail can be off-putting to someone who doesn't already have an appreciation for science. So let's start with a simplified description of the method that captures the essence.

You are doing science if you do the following. 

1. Pay attention to what you observe (via all of your senses).
2. Look for patterns in what you observe.
3. Propose explanations for the patterns you observe.
4. Reject any explanation that is contradicted by any observation.

There is more to the scientific method that you'll need to apply to your work if you want to be a professional scientist. But if you incorporate all four of these behaviors into your life then science is already a part of your worldview.

TODO: Provide a more complete description of the scientific method.
