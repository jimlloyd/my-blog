## Mission Statement 

This site is a work in progress and might eventually be published as a book. 

It is currently the work of one person, Jim Lloyd, but Jim hopes that eventually others will want to contribute to the work. This Mission Statement defines Jim's goals and is directed at anyone who is considering becoming a contributor.

The subject of this work is the **scientific worldview**. The intended audience of this work is anyone who (for whatever reason) does currently hold a scientific worldview but (for whatever reason) is curious to understand better what it is like to be someone that holds a scientific worldview.

We will consider it a success whenever a reader gains a good enough understanding of the scientific worldview that they understand the scientific method and have a realistic understanding of the capabilities and limitations of science.
